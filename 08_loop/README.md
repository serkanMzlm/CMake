**while():** stays inside the loop as long as the specified condition is true

**foreach():** It takes the list elements in it one by one and assigns it to the specified variable. It stays in the loop until the list is finished.

```
foreach(x RANGE 10)  start
foreach(x RANGE 10 20)  start, end
foreach(x RANGE 10 20 5) start, end, increment amount
```
